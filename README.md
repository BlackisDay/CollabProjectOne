# CollabProjectOne
Create a website that can contain both Music and Weather Forecast.

//Must include three pages. 404 Page, Weather Page, and a Music Page(Doing it like this will seem a bit more professional that way we can show page redirection.)

The top of the music page can show the current weather for your area, while the forecast page can show the forecast for an area of your choosing for the next five days.

Weather Forecast for your area will include your lat,lon. To do this we must find a way to include something(maybe an API) which will gather your current Lat,Lon.

Weather forecast for another area will have to find the Lat,Lon for that specific area when you click search.  It will grab the forecast for the next five days. Which will include Humidity, Temperature, and so forth.

//I believe it should have a navbar for both redirecting to pages. An ABOUT US, Contact(We can decide on whomever sees this can try to contact us with whatever contact method is there) 

//Music should focus mainly in the body. We can decide how to make it look together
For music page, we will have to be able to search up whomever we want.
Be able to check what artists they listen too and so forth.

This Collab Project will eventually be included in the Portfolio for future references for employers.
